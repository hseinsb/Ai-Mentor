## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Install [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (>=3.13.0)
- Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)

### 1. Set Up Flutter
```bash
# Check Flutter installation
flutter doctor

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code for data models
dart pub global activate build_runner
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

### 2. Firebase Project Setup

#### Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click "Create a project"
3. Name it "ai-mentor-app" 
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional)

#### Enable Required Services
In your Firebase project, enable:
- **Authentication** â†’ Email/Password, Google, Apple
- **Cloud Firestore** â†’ Start in test mode
- **Cloud Functions** â†’ Upgrade to Blaze plan (required for external API calls)
- **Cloud Storage** â†’ Start in test mode
- **Cloud Messaging** â†’ No setup needed yet

#### Configure Firebase CLI
```bash
# Install and login
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login

# Initialize in your project
firebase init
# Select: Functions, Firestore, Storage
# Choose existing project: ai-mentor-app
```

### 3. Connect Flutter to Firebase

#### Install FlutterFire CLI
```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

#### Configure for your platforms
```bash
# Configure Firebase for Flutter
flutterfire configure

# This will:
# - Update lib/firebase_options.dart with your project config
# - Download google-services.json for Android
# - Download GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS
```

### 4. Deploy Cloud Functions

#### Set up OpenAI API
1. Get API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set Firebase environment variable:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set openai.api_key="your-openai-api-key"
```

#### Deploy Functions
```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### 5. Deploy Firestore Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 6. Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Privacy-First Architecture [[memory:4437357]]
- All AI analysis questions are internal to the logic
- User data never leaves Firebase ecosystem
- Local encryption option for sensitive notes
- Complete data export/deletion capabilities

### Cost-Optimized AI Usage
- Token limits enforced at function level
- Cheaper models for most operations
- Response length caps (120 words)
- Rule-based scoring + LLM refinement approach

### Singles-Only Focus
- Onboarding specifically for singles
- Red Flag Radar as core "Aha Moment"
- Multiple people evaluation support
- Private mentor positioning (not dating app)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Configuration**
   ```bash
   # If firebase config fails
   flutterfire configure --force
   ```

2. **Build Runner Issues**
   ```bash
   # Clean and regenerate
   flutter packages pub run build_runner clean
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

3. **Function Deployment**
   ```bash
   # If functions fail to deploy
   cd functions
   npm install
   firebase deploy --only functions --debug
   ```

### Performance Tips
- Run `flutter analyze` to check code quality
- Use `flutter doctor` to verify setup
- Test on physical devices for accurate performance
